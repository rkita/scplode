scplode

- "Scplode" your disk space to get faster manipulation of your single cell data with less memory.  

Premise
- Disk space is cheap. Time is not. Memory is not. 
- A one time index is often worth it. 

Comparators
- Backed adata: Full featured. But slower. 
- Bionemo: Similar memory map. Heavier weight, not the familiar mechanism for exploring. 
- Scdataset: Not designed for data manipulation.

Install
-  pip install scplode
